<p>I'm not very good at cooking or baking myself, but I liked the idea of it so here we go.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>3 Eggs</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Cinnamon</li>
    <li>Leaveners</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Cranberries</li>
    <li>Walnuts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch bread loaf pans.</li>
    <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light yellow and frothy. Add white sugar, zucchini, oil,
        bananas, brown sugar, and vanilla; beat until well combined. Stir in flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking
        soda, and salt. Fold in cranberries and nuts. Divide batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow
        to cool in the loaf pans on a wire rack before removing and serving.</li>
